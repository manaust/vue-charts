# The art of rendering a chart

Supplementary code for my [Belvue Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nl-NL/belvue-be/events/281427070/) talk regarding a Vue-based approach for rendering D3 charts.

## Setup

Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
yarn dev -o
```

Happy hacking!
